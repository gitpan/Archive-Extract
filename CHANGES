Changes for 0.15_01 Fri Nov 24 15:07:44 2006
============================================
* Apply patch from Paul Marquess to add pure
  perl support for bzip2 encoded files. This 
  support requires you to have the module
  IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2 installed.
* Error storage is now per object like it should
  be rather than class wide.
* Update tests to not skip unnecessarily  
* Up required version of IPC::Cmd to 0.36 for 
  5.6.x compatibility
* Improve diagnostics in the test suite when
  run verbosely
  
Changes for 0.14    Fri Oct 20 14:37:36 2006
============================================
* Tweak tests to play nicer on win32
* Up required version of IPC::Cmd

Changes for 0.12    Sun Aug 13 14:55:54 2006
============================================
* Add diagnostics during the test suite informing
  the user that File::Spec warnings may be 
  generated by Archive::Zip (see rt #19713).
  These are safe to ignore.

Changes for 0.11_02 Thu Aug  3 14:18:16 2006
============================================
* attempt to address #19815: make test fail under Cygwin
  again. Unzip giving trouble this time. Adding -o 
  option to force overwriting of old files
* address #20829: test failure on Win32: no bunzip2?
  bunzip2 detection wasn't working properly in the
  test suite so tests weren't skipped on missing
  bunzip2
