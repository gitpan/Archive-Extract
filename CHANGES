Changes for 0.26    Sun Jan 27 16:31:20 2008
============================================
* Address #32370: Archive::Extract will hang if stdin 
  is a pipe. /bin/bunzip2 tried to read STDIN when printing
  out it's '--version'. 
* Address rt #32336 by a.r.ferreira@gmail.com to add .lzma 
  support to archive::extract 
* Older versions of bunzip2 insist on a .bz2 suffix to extract 
  things. Guard against this, adapt the test suite and mention 
  it in the caveats. 

Changes for 0.24    Thu Sep 20 15:05:55 2007
============================================
* Older versions of /bin/bunzip2 only support archives
  with a .bz2 suffix. Attempt to detect this with a new
  method ->have_old_bunzip2, and skip tests accordingly.
  Also document this in the CAVEATS section of the docs.
* Apply core change 31904: Clean up test files left 
  behind (on Win32, at least).

Changes for 0.23_01 Sun Sep  9 12:39:08 2007
============================================
* Address Update ticket #27991 (Archive::Extract and 
  very large tar.gz files). Add a CAVEATS entry explianing 
  how to deal with large files & memory consumption 
* VMS shell out & test fixes by John Malmberg

Changes for 0.22    Tue May 29 21:18:46 2007
============================================
* Manifest didn't include one of the source files
  for tests. If you have 0.20 installed there is no
  need to upgrade. This is just a test suite fix.
  
Changes for 0.20    Mon May 28 12:06:33 2007
============================================
* Address #27195: Implement support for .Z files.
* Small POD fixes
* Disable some test diagnostics under perl core tests

Changes for 0.18    Wed Apr 11 21:20:53 2007
============================================
* Starting 5.9.5, this module installs itself in
  the core-perl dir, rather than site-perl, as it's
  now part of core.
* Reverse '$PREFER_BIN' conditional for tar/tar.gz
  files. The current logic was actually exactly the
  wrong way around.
* Small regex change to tar/tar.gz detection.  

Changes for 0.16    Fri Jan 26 11:07:24 2007
============================================
* address #24578: Wrong check for `type' argument
* add new method ->types that returns a list of
  all supported archive types
* promote 0.15_03 to stable  

Changes for 0.15_03 Thu Jan  4 14:46:58 2007
============================================
* address #23999: Attempt to generate Makefile.PL 
  gone awry where paths starting with a '.' 
  are sometimes reported to be extracted in '.' 
  as well rather than their actual extraction dir.

Changes for 0.15_02 Sun Nov 26 18:06:02 2006
============================================
* fix testing logic error, that assumed extracted 
  files were always logged when we did not prefer 
  binaries to extract with. However, that does not 
  mean the perl module is available, so we might 
  not have buffers after all.
* make sure we dont have test count mismatches 
  between buffers/non-buffers

Changes for 0.15_01 Fri Nov 24 15:07:44 2006
============================================
* Apply patch from Paul Marquess to add pure
  perl support for bzip2 encoded files. This 
  support requires you to have the module
  IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2 installed.
* Error storage is now per object like it should
  be rather than class wide.
* Update tests to not skip unnecessarily  
* Up required version of IPC::Cmd to 0.36 for 
  5.6.x compatibility
* Improve diagnostics in the test suite when
  run verbosely
  
Changes for 0.14    Fri Oct 20 14:37:36 2006
============================================
* Tweak tests to play nicer on win32
* Up required version of IPC::Cmd

Changes for 0.12    Sun Aug 13 14:55:54 2006
============================================
* Add diagnostics during the test suite informing
  the user that File::Spec warnings may be 
  generated by Archive::Zip (see rt #19713).
  These are safe to ignore.

Changes for 0.11_02 Thu Aug  3 14:18:16 2006
============================================
* attempt to address #19815: make test fail under Cygwin
  again. Unzip giving trouble this time. Adding -o 
  option to force overwriting of old files
* address #20829: test failure on Win32: no bunzip2?
  bunzip2 detection wasn't working properly in the
  test suite so tests weren't skipped on missing
  bunzip2

Changes for 0.11_01 Wed Aug  2 13:04:37 2006
============================================
* attempt to address #19815: make test fail under Cygwin
  by adding more sanity checks about buffers 

Changes for 0.11    Wed Aug  2 11:15:48 2006
============================================
* add tentative bzip2 support
